## Welcome! Here is my web development projects folder~  
The app landing page was created with Bootstrap when I start to learn that.  
The reaction tester game generated random graphic images at random time intervals and players were prompted to click the image as quickly as possible to test their reaction time.  
The code player can run all the code the player entered in the separate areas of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The private diary enabled users to sign in, log in and out using their own email and password. Data input by users would automatically and simultaneously save to users page and the online database.
